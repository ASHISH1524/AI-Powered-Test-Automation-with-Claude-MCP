# AI-Powered-Test-Automation-with-Claude-MCP
Demonstrating Zero-Code Test Automation using Claude AI Agent with Model Context Protocol (MCP)

🎯 Project Overview
This repository showcases a revolutionary approach to test automation using AI agents instead of traditional scripting frameworks. By leveraging Claude AI with Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, I've achieved fully autonomous test execution without writing a single line of automation code.
🚀 What's Demonstrated

AI-Driven Testing: Complete test automation using natural language instructions
MCP Integration: Seamless connection between Claude AI and web applications
Zero-Code Approach: No Selenium scripts, no maintenance overhead
Intelligent Decision Making: AI agent handles dynamic elements and validations autonomously
Real-time Adaptation: Smart handling of UI changes and unexpected scenarios
